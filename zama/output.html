How do you know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a startup culture that is obsessed with management by metrics, many founders struggle to answer this critical question about themselves. It’s tempting to measure leaders simply by the success of their businesses. But even the most successful founders know how much timing and luck can be confounding factors in this approach. Measuring leadership through bottom-line company performance also fails to provide any clues as to how someone can improve as a leader. So is there a better way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis essay describes a way to measure leadership that I hope will be helpful to those who seek to improve as leaders. It is based on observations I made when working closely with four leaders that I consider extraordinary: Ed Catmull (Pixar’s founder), Steve Jobs (Pixar’s CEO), John Lasseter (Pixar’s Chief Creative Officer), and Bob Iger (Disney’s CEO). To my surprise, these men could not have been more different in style, temperament, and approach. They did not conform to a single model of leadership. One was an introverted scientist while another was an extroverted artist. One was a college dropout who had founded a company and was infamous for brash behavior while another was a career executive who was exceptionally genteel and diplomatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite their differences, these men were able to create an extraordinary amount of trust in the people around them. They built trust by doing the same three things exceptionally well, though each in his own way. I believe that these three traits are the foundational traits of great leaders You cannot be a great leader without them because you cannot build trust without them. And the trick to measuring leadership is to measure a leader’s effectiveness along these three dimensions, as detailed in the notes section \u003ca href=\&quot;https://ycombinator.wpengine.com/how-do-you-measure-leadership/#survey-questions\&quot;\u003eat the end of this post\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThree Foundational Characteristics of Great Leaders\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that people of all temperaments, personality types, and personal/professional backgrounds can be great leaders, and that they can lead quite differently and still be successful. But to be trusted and followed as a leader, you must excel in three key areas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1\u0026#46; Clarity of Thought and Communication\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat leaders think and communicate clearly. They describe a vision of the future that people find compelling to work hard to achieve. If your employees are confused about your mission and strategy, or do not find it motivating or credible, they will not follow you with the focus and determination necessary to succeed.\u003csup id=\&quot;footnoteid1\&quot;\u003e\u003ca href=\&quot;#footnote1\&quot;\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClarity of thought always precedes clarity of language. To improve your communication, the best thing you can do is to spend more time thinking about what you believe is truly important for your business. Once you’ve crystallized what’s important for everyone to understand, practice expressing it in simple terms. Simplicity is vital. A great example is the retail strategy that Amazon’s Jeff Bezos \u003ca href=\&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-brilliant-advice-for-anyone-running-a-business-2015-1\&quot;\u003ecommunicated\u003c/a\u003e to his team years ago. He based it on three simple but enduring customer preferences: lower prices, bigger selection, and faster delivery. To this day, anything Amazon employees do to lower prices, expand selection, and accelerate delivery creates value for the customer and advances the company’s strategy. As Bezos said, “You can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time\u0026#8230;.when you have something that you know is true, even over the long-term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking time to prepare internal communications becomes increasingly important as your company grows. As you scale, your employee base grows more diverse, and fewer of your employees have a personal relationship with you. Hence, they are much less likely to just “know what you mean” and more likely to be confused and critical if you don’t communicate well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat leaders spend hours preparing their internal communications. They don’t just wing it, no matter how naturally talented they are as communicators. As an example, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke and his senior team spend hundreds of hours preparing for their annual employee Summit. As Tobi says, “We want to be a loosely coupled, highly aligned company. The Summit is the main enabler of this because it is a grand sync. We spend countless hours preparing because if we communicate well at the Summit, we achieve great alignment by the end. We can then use our weekly townhalls to keep us from drifting too far apart until the next Summit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2\u0026#46; Judgment about People\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat leaders have great intuition about people, particularly when it comes to selecting people to whom they give power and responsibility. They are able to see hidden potential in people and detect cases where ambition exceeds ability. And when they make hiring or promotion mistakes, which are inevitable, they have the courage to rectify the situation if the employee cannot be coached to improve. Nothing does more damage to an organization or to the standing of a leader than picking the wrong leaders or failing to correct these mistakes when they happen. The judgment around the initial hiring or promotion decision is the most important, as leaders who fire too many of their own also lose a lot of credibility and trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everyone is naturally gifted when it comes to intuition about people, but everyone can improve. Gathering more data will help you make better people decisions. When looking to hire leaders, try to meet as many of the best people in the field as possible as a way to sharpen your recognition skills. Spend as much time as you can getting to know executives that you are considering hiring. In a \u003ca href=\&quot;http://www.geekwire.com/2016/qa-uber-cto/\&quot;\u003e2016 interview\u003c/a\u003e, Uber CTO Thuan Pham describes being interviewed by CEO Travis Kalanick for “30 hours straight, one-on-one, over two weeks,” including over Skype when Travis was traveling. “Throughout those 30 hours,” Pham continued, “I actually forgot it was an interview. It was just like a discussion between two colleagues.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also helps to do extensive reference checks on hires and ask for examples of behavior that shows good judgment and high integrity because these traits are hard to test in an interview. And try to learn from cases when you hire or promote the wrong person and are not able to coach them to improve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3\u0026#46; Personal Integrity and Commitment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat leaders have exceptional personal integrity and commitment to their mission. Integrity means standing for something meaningful beyond oneself rather than being motivated by narrow personal interests. It means being able to admit when you have made a mistake rather than acting like you are always right and having the humility to receive critical feedback openly and work to improve. It means avoiding behavior like favoritism, conflicts of interest, inappropriate language, inappropriate work relationships, etc., that erode trust. A useful test is to ask yourself: if your team had full transparency into your private communications and behavior towards employees, would you be embarrassed by anything you have done or said? This is a high bar, but one that great leaders strive to meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond putting in the time, great leaders make their work into their core life mission in ways that inspire others. They derive deep personal meaning and fulfillment from leading people to achieve a mission. Their personal commitment translates into high levels of personal productivity and execution, which in turn becomes the foundation for pushing their organizations to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIt All Adds Up To Trust\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how do you know you are good leader? You are a good leader if you excel in the three areas described above and thereby earn the trust of the people around you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding trust in this way is both a science and an art; it requires both competence and character. Trust is built when leaders think clearly about the future and move their organizations to the right place, in terms of product, sales, and people. Do the predictions you make about the future – about the products you should build, the investments you should make, and the changes in competitive or technological landscape – prove to be accurate? And do the people you have chosen to lead in your organization prove to be the right ones? Over time, the answers to these questions become known, and if you answer a lot of these questions correctly, you earn trust. I consider this the “science” of building trust. It’s built on clarity of thought, good communication, and good judgment about people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe art of building trust is more complicated. It is closely tied with a leader’s ability to communicate with integrity. It is built when you say the right thing at the right time, and show empathy and good judgment. It grows when you stand for ideals bigger than yourself rather than caring primarily about your personal success, wealth, fame, or position. It also grows when you are honest with others, admitting what you don’t know, and not trying to be someone else. This is why you can’t try to copy Steve Jobs or Ed Catmull in your quest to be a great leader. You can only be yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost leaders understand the science of building trust. They understand that they need to think and communicate clearly about product and strategy and make good choices when they are hiring and promoting people into leadership positions. They understand that they have to show deep commitment and get things done. But in my experience, the truly great leaders also understand the art of building trust. Leaders have to make many hard decisions – firing people, taking responsibility for mistakes, disappointing people by saying no, etc. Great leaders treat these challenges as opportunities to build trust. They ask themselves which course of action and which style of communication will increase the trust that employees have in them. When faced with a difficult challenge, they optimize for trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, perhaps, is the lesson that great leaders teach everyone else. In difficult times, as you evaluate one course of action versus another, ask yourself which path will generate more trust in you as a person and as a leader. Always try to choose that path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThanks to Tobi Lütke, Tyler Bosmeny, Daniel Yanisse, David Rusenko, Sam Altman, Michael Seibel, and the YC Continuity team for reading drafts of this essay.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/b\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/b\u003e \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\&quot;survey-questions\&quot;\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTES:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\&quot;color: #888888;\&quot;\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSurvey Questions for Evaluating Leaders\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\&quot;color: #888888;\&quot;\u003eThe best approach to measuring leadership is to evaluate a leader’s performance in the three areas in which all great leaders must excel: clarity of thought / communication, judgment about people, and personal integrity / commitment.

It’s tempting to\nmeasure leaders simply by the success of their businesses. But even the most\nsuccessful founders know how much timing and luck can be confounding factors in\nthis approach. Measuring leadership through bottom-line company performance also\nfails to provide any clues as to how someone can improve as a le&quot;,&quot;reading_time&quot;:9,&quot;access&quot;:true,&quot;og_image&quot;:null,&quot;og_title&quot;:null,&quot;og_description&quot;:null,&quot;twitter_image&quot;:null,&quot;twitter_title&quot;:null,&quot;twitter_description&quot;:null,&quot;meta_title&quot;:null,&quot;meta_description&quot;:null,&quot;email_subject&quot;:null,&quot;frontmatter&quot;:null,&quot;feature_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;feature_image_caption&quot;:null},&quot;mentions&quot;:[],&quot;related_posts&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;61fe29f1c7139e0001a7191b&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;395e6c97-7acc-49bb-9d6d-f833e439e99b&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;What’s the Second Job of a Startup CEO?&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;the-second-job-of-a-startup-ceo&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;\u003c!--kg-card-begin: html--\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuccessful startups go through three broad phases as they scale, and a startup CEO’s job changes dramatically in each phase. A CEO’s first job is to build a product users love; the second job is to build a company to maximize the opportunity that the product has surfaced; and the third is to harvest the profits of the core business to invest in transformative new product ideas. This blog post describes how to become a great Phase 2 CEO by focusing on the highest leverage tasks that only the CEO can accomplish. As YC’s Continuity team, we’ve seen many Phase 1 CEOs transition successfully into Phase 2, and some who have not. The future of your startup depends on which kind you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour First Creation is a Product, Your Second Creation is a Company\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA CEO’s first job is to build a great product and find a small group of people who love it and use it enthusiastically.\u003csup id=\&quot;footnoteid1\&quot;\u003e\u003ca href=\&quot;#footnote1\&quot;\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e A Phase 1 startup CEO is the Doer-in-Chief. You must be deeply involved in both building the product (observing/interacting with users, writing code, designing product specs) and acquiring users/customers. Delegation should not be a word in your vocabulary. If you succeed, it’s because your deep involvement and unique vision give the company a perspective and drive that few others have. The other imperative for a Phase 1 CEO is to conserve money in order to extend the time to iterate and improve the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost startups fail because they are not able to create a product that users love enough to abandon existing alternatives. Success in this first phase means discovering more demand for your product than your small team can handle. When this happens, you have to shift your focus as CEO to building a company that can capture and maximize the demand that your product has surfaced. Company-building becomes the CEO’s primary job in a Phase 2 startup. The company you build is your second creation and will be your lasting legacy as a founder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Phase 2 CEO, you need to transition from “Doer-in-Chief” to “Company-Builder-in-Chief.” This is how you scale as a CEO, and CEO scaling is the first step in company-building. For most founders, this is very difficult. When you’ve been a successful Doer-in-Chief, it’s hard to stop. It’s hard to stop coding, designing product specs, and interacting with customers on a daily basis. It’s hard to stop answering support tickets, doing all the product demos, and debugging the latest build. It’s even hard to delegate the random and sometimes menial tasks that you’ve accumulated over the years because they were “no one’s job.” But you have to stop doing all of these things so that you can safeguard your time for high leverage tasks that only CEOs can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis transition can cause confusion and even friction with your team, who can suddenly wonder what you are doing if you’re no longer committing code or why you’re suddenly delegating a bunch of menial tasks that you’d been doing for years. But once your startup reaches 20-30 people, you’ll have to spend more time leading (i.e., directing the activities of others). And since time is finite, the only way to lead more is do less. Without delegating, you simply won’t have time to focus on company-building and you’ll end up slowing everyone else down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may seem impossible at first, but you can eventually delegate day-to-day responsibility for everything you did in Phase 1, even Product. You obviously can’t drop everything overnight, but your job is to replace yourself by hiring people better than you into leadership positions. As David Rusenko, the co-founder and CEO of Weebly has said, “Often, the first time I find out about a product feature is reading about it on our blog. It shocks most founders to hear this, but I know I’ve done my job well because I’ve yet to see a feature that was built poorly. You should aspire to build a team that’s so good that you don’t have to be involved in the product details.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice, Phase 2 usually begins when a startup has around 20-25 employees and ends when it reaches 400-500 employees. At the end of Phase 2, you’ll have a leadership team that you’ve “road tested” to the point that you can confidently delegate everything you did in Phase 1. Your direct reports should be experienced leaders who can perform at a high level with minimal involvement from you, provided that you have set direction well. You can then shift the burden of company building to your leadership team so that you can start working on Phase 3: taking profits from the core business and investing them in new, transformative products. As an example, Facebook built its senior management team in Phase 2 while running the business at roughly breakeven. In Phase 3, it began to generate huge profits in its core business thanks to more lucrative in-stream ads, so it could allocate significant resources towards Messenger as a separate product and buy Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThree Tasks That CEOs Can’t Delegate\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStated simply, your job as a Phase 2 startup CEO is to delegate everything you did in Phase 1 in order to create time to focus on three critical operational tasks that only the CEO can do \u003csup id=\&quot;footnoteid2\&quot;\u003e\u003ca href=\&quot;#footnote2\&quot;\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1\u0026#46; Hiring a Leadership Team and Making Sure They Work Well Together\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the CEO can hire the company’s senior leadership team and make sure that they work well together. You can get help and feedback from others as you hire, but when you bring leaders like a VP of Engineering, VP of Sales, and CFO on board, the ultimate hiring decisions must be yours. You can’t hire by compromise, looking for someone who everyone around you likes. The choice has to be yours because the consequences are yours as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecruiting senior executives takes an extraordinary amount of time. If you are doing it for the first time, meet lots of people so that you can develop good judgment about the skills, experiences, and personality traits that you need. Patrick Collison, co-founder and CEO of Stripe, made it a point to meet with the “best-in-the-world” in each field so he could get a sense of what a great candidate looks like. Because executive hiring takes so much time, you should stage these hires rather than trying to hire everyone at once. Our recommendation is to hire a good executive search firm to help you run your first couple of searches. It will cost you an arm and a leg, but if it helps you hire the right person, it’s worth every penny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYC teaches founders to manage their startups using weekly milestones to ensure rapid iteration and progress. That’s great for a small company trying to find product-market fit, but it’s not the way to manage senior executives. You manage senior people to longer term outputs rather than week-to-week tasks. To do this well, you first have to set the right quarterly and annual milestones for the company and for each executive. It’s also your job to acclimate new executives to the culture of the company. As you build your senior team, expect to spend extra time with new executives individually and as a team on culture and teamwork. You should insist that new executives take the time to build relationships across the organization rather than pressuring them to come in and start changing things immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning how to evaluate the performance of senior executives is also a challenge, partly because your face-to-face interactions do not provide much of the information you need. You have to evaluate how well they are building their organizations, how productive and happy their employees are, and how well they are working with other teams and executives. You should expect that at least 25% of your leadership hires don’t work out. For most startup CEOs, it’s very difficult to fire their first executive, and most CEOs take too long to do it. But it’s better to act quickly and leave a void in the organization than to leave an ineffective senior executive in place for too long. The longer you leave an under-performing executive in place, the more credibility you lose with everyone else on your team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour job is done when your entire leadership team has been hired, you’ve coached them to work well together, and they can operate at a high level with minimal involvement from you. Don’t be surprised if 50% of your time goes to hiring and managing your senior team; it’s time well spent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\&quot;creating-purpose-and-alignment\&quot;\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2\u0026#46; Creating Purpose and Alignment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second task that CEOs cannot delegate is creating purpose and alignment at the company. When your startup has less than 10 people who all sit together, you don’t need to work very hard to keep people aligned. Everyone can easily hear what’s going on, understand how their work fits into the broader goals, and have a say in every decision. Communication is simple and creating alignment is easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when you start hiring more people, soon in different offices and from broader backgrounds and functions (e.g., sales, finance, etc.), creating alignment becomes a lot harder. Your team no longer sits within earshot. You aren’t able to interview or even meet everyone who joins the company. And you may not even able to attend employee onboarding sessions. As an example, there was an 18-month period at Twitter where the company was hiring 50 people per month in offices all around the world. There was no way the CEO or any one executive could meet everyone who was joining the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Phase 1 CEO, you are the lead rower on the boat. But in a Phase 2 startup, your job is no longer to row. Instead, it’s to define the purpose of the voyage, set the direction of the boat, and measure the pace and performance of a much larger number of rowers. In business speak, the CEO’s job is to define the Mission (purpose), Strategy (direction), and Metrics (pace and performance). These three elements provide the essential context that a growing company needs to be able to perform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the best examples of “Mission-to-Metrics” alignment comes from a friend who visited the manufacturing floor at SpaceX. Seeing a SpaceX employee assembling a large part, he stopped to ask him, “What is your job at SpaceX?” He answered, “The mission of SpaceX is to colonize Mars. In order to colonize Mars, we need to build reusable rockets because it will otherwise be unaffordable for humans to travel to Mars and back. My job is to help design the steering system that enables our rockets to land back on earth. You’ll know if I’ve succeeded if our rockets land on our platform in the Atlantic after launch.” The employee could have simply said he was building a steering system for landing rockets. Instead, he recited the company’s entire “Mission-to-Metrics” framework. That is alignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you define the Mission, Strategy, and Metrics for your startup in a way that’s clear, simple, and inspiring? Most Phase 2 CEOs can’t readily do this. And, when they sit down to define it, they find it harder than they thought. The diagram below captures the task at hand:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\&quot;https://ycombinator.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Artboard-2white_wborder.png\&quot;\u003e\u003cimg loading=\&quot;lazy\&quot; src=\&quot;https://ycombinator.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Artboard-2white_wborder.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;Mission-to-Metrics\&quot; width=\&quot;1016\&quot; height=\&quot;981\&quot; class=\&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097571\&quot; srcset=\&quot;https://ghost.prod.ycinside.com/content/images/wordpress/2016/11/Artboard-2white_wborder.png 1016w, https://ghost.prod.ycinside.com/content/images/wordpress/2016/11/Artboard-2white_wborder-300x290.png 300w, https://ghost.prod.ycinside.com/content/images/wordpress/2016/11/Artboard-2white_wborder-768x742.png 768w\&quot; sizes=\&quot;(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\&quot; /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour mission should feel ambitious and permanent. It should find its roots in the reasons you started your company and should not be something that you change very often. Conversely, you should revisit your product strategy and go-to-market strategy at least twice per year to make sure they remain relevant and right. There is an enormous amount of literature about developing business and product strategy. Whatever approach you choose, a simple practice always seems to help: write it down. In our experience, the CEOs who are most effective in developing and communicating strategy take the time to write their strategy out, in long form. You don’t have to go as far as Jeff Bezos and his team at Amazon do, requiring 6 page memos for every strategic meeting. But writing your “Mission-to-Metrics” framework in long form will help you be more thorough and catch flaws in your thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffective metric-setting is also a critical part of a CEO’s job. A common mistake is to equate key internal metrics with the business’ most important top line results, like revenue or user growth. This is the wrong approach because top line results like “increase user growth” usually aren’t directly actionable. Instead, you’ve got to dig deeper to understand what drives top line results and set these drivers as the key internal metrics. Great companies work tirelessly to understand what drives their growth. Facebook famously discovered that connecting a new user to 10 friends within 14 days correlated with retained usage, so they set “number of new users with 10 friend connections” as the key product metric. You’ve got to be tenacious about learning what drives your top line business results and set those drivers are your internal metrics. If you don’t know what drives revenue, customer acquisition, or user growth, you aren’t likely to be successful anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve written “Mission-to-Metrics” for your startup, and gotten feedback from your leadership and other key employees, you have to start communicating it to everyone regularly. You have to reiterate the Mission-to-Metrics much more than what feels reasonable, which may run counter to your instinct to be efficient. Your employees will not internalize the message unless you communicate it constantly. The real test is not simply whether employees can repeat it, but whether they can make good decisions in your absence based on the context you have provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3\u0026#46; Nurturing Company Culture\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are few concepts in company building that are as slippery as culture. Fundamentally, culture is defined by the way people treat one another in a company \u0026#8212; both the way management treats employees and the way people treat one another. Culture begins to form on the day the second person joins your startup. How founders and early employees act toward one another in a startup’s earliest days sets a cultural tone that can last for many years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut unlike the other tasks listed above, creating a good culture is not uniquely the CEO’s job. It is everyone’s responsibility. So unlike Mission-to-Metrics, a CEO’s job is not to go to a quiet room and write up a set of cultural tenets for everyone to follow. This single-author approach usually fails because the resulting words are often disconnected from the reality of how the employees as a whole experience the company. Rather than assuming the burden of sole authorship, CEOs should encourage co-founders and early employees to work together to codify a set of values and behavioral norms that feel authentic and aspirational to everyone. For culture to be self-enforcing, the values must resonate with the ways the company has acted in the past. That\u0026#8217;s how they feel authentic rather than contrived. If you really want the company to embody a value that does not reflect past behavior, then set an example and get everyone in leadership to act in that way before you consider calling it a company value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePixar provides a helpful example. Like most movie studios, Pixar says that one of its key values is that “story comes first.” And like most companies, it says that its employees are its most important asset. Pixar’s employees embrace these values because they authentically represent the way the company has behaved. The most powerful example dates back to the making of Toy Story 2 in 1999. With only seven months to go before its scheduled release date, Pixar’s creative leadership felt that Toy Story 2 was not working creatively. Disney, Pixar’s distribution partner, knew that it took 3-4 years to make an animated film. They argued that it was too late to start over and that Pixar should release the film as is. But Pixar refused, deciding instead to tear up the story and re-write it from scratch. The studio pushed itself to the brink of collapse to complete the new version of Toy Story 2 on time, and the film was a huge commercial and critical success. And, when it was completed, the executive team took the extraordinary step of closing the studio for two entire months to let everyone recuperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Catmull calls it the most intense and important period in the studio’s history: “Toy Story 2 defined us. It said that we couldn’t be a studio that produced both great work and average work. Everything we made had to be great. We proved to ourselves that we would never release a film when we were not proud of the story. And we also realized that we had to take care of our people if we were going to ask such sacrifices from them.” Nothing expresses the core cultural tenets of Pixar better: Do not compromise creatively and take care of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat defines you as a company? You should look to the past to find the answer, often to your earliest days when success was far from certain. Perhaps it’s a commitment to quality, like “story comes first.” Perhaps it’s a mode of working, like “go fast and break things.” Once these values have been expressed, the CEO must make sure that the behavior of every new leader at the company reflects those values. But here too, adherence is not solely the CEO’s job. Everyone at the company also has a role to play in holding their leaders, peers, and themselves accountable to the same norms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Simple Measure of Success\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a management meeting at Pixar, I once heard Steve Jobs say, “When I’m at my best, 50% of my time is unscheduled. That’s the time I use to think, drop in on the people I want to speak with, and let my curiosity roam. It\u0026#8217;s my time to be creative. Without this free time, I would never be able to stay ahead of the company. To lead a company, you’ve always got to be two steps ahead. There’s no way to lead a company from behind.” Reaching the point of having a lot of unscheduled think time is perhaps the clearest sign of success for a Phase 2 CEO. It suggests that you have hired a leadership team, delegated the day-to-day activities to them, and codified Mission, Strategy, and Metrics well enough for them to operate effectively without your daily involvement. Your reward is the bounty of time to think and plan the future of your startup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTES:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb id=\&quot;footnote1\&quot;\u003e1\u003c/b\u003e No one has written more eloquently about this topic than YC co-founder Paul Graham in essays like \u003ca href=\&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html\&quot;\u003eHow To Start A Startup\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html\&quot;\u003eDo Things That Don’t Scale\u003c/a\u003e.\u003ca href=\&quot;#footnoteid1\&quot;\u003e↩\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb id=\&quot;footnote2\&quot;\u003e2\u003c/b\u003e The focus of this essay is on a CEO’s operational responsibilities.

Often companies improve their conversion rate by hiring a dedicated growth team – but it is difficult to build a system from scratch and hire the engineers to do so. Jaleh and her co-founder decided to create a no code platform and serve as the world’s growth team. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4:25\u003c/strong\u003e - Jaleh elaborates on the challenges growth teams face in conversion optimization. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTeams first source and use data to understand the part of the funnel to prioritize. Then they estimate revenue improvements and brainstorm tactics to improve conversion. (The time invested compared to impact is taken into consideration.) Finally, the engineers build a measurement system to capture the impact of those changes. The entire process takes months. With Mutiny, this process takes minutes even for people who aren’t technical and has a massive impact on teams’ ability to launch new experiences and optimize conversion. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9:00\u003c/strong\u003e - When should a startup use Mutiny? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are use cases for pre-product market fit companies (as long as you know the customers you want to go after) and post-product market fit.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExample 1: \u003ca href=\&quot;https://www.mutinyhq.com/playbooks/personalize-paid-landing-pages-to-reduce-cost-per-lead\&quot;\u003eNotion drives 60% more leads through paid marketing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExample 2: \u003ca href=\&quot;https://www.mutinyhq.com/blog/the-second-lever-replays#conversion-secret-how-snowflake-runs-abm-at-scale\&quot;\u003eSnowflake builds an ABM and enterprise marketing program\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12:50\u003c/strong\u003e - You recently shared that with data and AI, Mutiny transforms conversion from a niche A/B testing tool to a platform that every go-to-market team can use to drive efficient growth at scale. What does that mean, and how have you leveraged the advances in AI over the last four years? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen you can give the entire go-to-market team x-ray vision into every visitor and how they are converting – and then pair that insight with the ability to change the website for different segments – every team will make the website a core part of their strategy to drive more revenue. Mutiny uses AI to give teams this insight and answer questions like: What segments should I prioritize? What parts of the website should I change? What copy will resonate? Where should I focus? \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e17:00\u003c/strong\u003e - At Mutiny when looking at data, when do you know the right questions to ask and when do you say these are not questions we need to optimize now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the early days, one of the most valuable things we did was follow our customers’ growth teams.

As our customers grew, our data set grew and we used AI models and inputs to improve our recommendation engines and service a broader customer base.

Your long-term vision (i.e. the opportunity and what you’re trying to create over the course of a decade) provides clarity around where you’re trying to go and brings other people along with you, like your investors and employees. Day-to-day, you’re focused and executing quickly – and not always thinking about the ten year vision when you’re building V1.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e43:45\u003c/strong\u003e - You decided to grow your team by acquiring Intellipse.

And as a result, a much larger portion of the market is open to a new and better way. We’re in a recession, and this is an inflection point for Mutiny. Companies need to convert every dollar to a customer, and Mutiny has built a product that makes marketing dollars more efficient.

When a company is working toward a similar goal – building something we would have done ourselves – it is a successful acquisition. With Intellipse, the team shared similar goals and company culture, and could accelerate our timing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe want to hire founders onto our product team who are user focused and move quickly.

How do you know?</p>
<p>In a startup culture that is obsessed with management by metrics, many founders struggle to answer this critical question about themselves. It’s tempting to measure leaders simply by the success of their businesses. But even the most successful founders know how much timing and luck can be confounding factors in this approach. Measuring leadership through bottom-line company performance also fails to provide any clues as to how someone can improve as a leader. So is there a better way?</p>
<p>This essay describes a way to measure leadership that I hope will be helpful to those who seek to improve as leaders. It is based on observations I made when working closely with four leaders that I consider extraordinary: Ed Catmull (Pixar’s founder), Steve Jobs (Pixar’s CEO), John Lasseter (Pixar’s Chief Creative Officer), and Bob Iger (Disney’s CEO). To my surprise, these men could not have been more different in style, temperament, and approach. They did not conform to a single model of leadership. One was an introverted scientist while another was an extroverted artist. One was a college dropout who had founded a company and was infamous for brash behavior while another was a career executive who was exceptionally genteel and diplomatic.</p>
<p>Despite their differences, these men were able to create an extraordinary amount of trust in the people around them. They built trust by doing the same three things exceptionally well, though each in his own way. I believe that these three traits are the foundational traits of great leaders You cannot be a great leader without them because you cannot build trust without them. And the trick to measuring leadership is to measure a leader’s effectiveness along these three dimensions, as detailed in the notes section <a href="https://ycombinator.wpengine.com/how-do-you-measure-leadership/#survey-questions">at the end of this post</a>.</p>
<h3>Three Foundational Characteristics of Great Leaders</h3>
<p>I believe that people of all temperaments, personality types, and personal/professional backgrounds can be great leaders, and that they can lead quite differently and still be successful. But to be trusted and followed as a leader, you must excel in three key areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Clarity of Thought and Communication</strong></p>
<p>Great leaders think and communicate clearly. They describe a vision of the future that people find compelling to work hard to achieve. If your employees are confused about your mission and strategy, or do not find it motivating or credible, they will not follow you with the focus and determination necessary to succeed.<sup id="footnoteid1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Clarity of thought always precedes clarity of language. To improve your communication, the best thing you can do is to spend more time thinking about what you believe is truly important for your business. Once you’ve crystallized what’s important for everyone to understand, practice expressing it in simple terms. Simplicity is vital. A great example is the retail strategy that Amazon’s Jeff Bezos <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-brilliant-advice-for-anyone-running-a-business-2015-1">communicated</a> to his team years ago. He based it on three simple but enduring customer preferences: lower prices, bigger selection, and faster delivery. To this day, anything Amazon employees do to lower prices, expand selection, and accelerate delivery creates value for the customer and advances the company’s strategy. As Bezos said, “You can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time….when you have something that you know is true, even over the long-term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.”</p>
<p>Taking time to prepare internal communications becomes increasingly important as your company grows. As you scale, your employee base grows more diverse, and fewer of your employees have a personal relationship with you. Hence, they are much less likely to just “know what you mean” and more likely to be confused and critical if you don’t communicate well.</p>
<p>Great leaders spend hours preparing their internal communications. They don’t just wing it, no matter how naturally talented they are as communicators. As an example, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke and his senior team spend hundreds of hours preparing for their annual employee Summit. As Tobi says, “We want to be a loosely coupled, highly aligned company. The Summit is the main enabler of this because it is a grand sync. We spend countless hours preparing because if we communicate well at the Summit, we achieve great alignment by the end. We can then use our weekly townhalls to keep us from drifting too far apart until the next Summit.”</p>
<p><strong>2. Judgment about People</strong></p>
<p>Great leaders have great intuition about people, particularly when it comes to selecting people to whom they give power and responsibility. They are able to see hidden potential in people and detect cases where ambition exceeds ability. And when they make hiring or promotion mistakes, which are inevitable, they have the courage to rectify the situation if the employee cannot be coached to improve. Nothing does more damage to an organization or to the standing of a leader than picking the wrong leaders or failing to correct these mistakes when they happen. The judgment around the initial hiring or promotion decision is the most important, as leaders who fire too many of their own also lose a lot of credibility and trust.</p>
<p>Not everyone is naturally gifted when it comes to intuition about people, but everyone can improve. Gathering more data will help you make better people decisions. When looking to hire leaders, try to meet as many of the best people in the field as possible as a way to sharpen your recognition skills. Spend as much time as you can getting to know executives that you are considering hiring. In a <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/qa-uber-cto/">2016 interview</a>, Uber CTO Thuan Pham describes being interviewed by CEO Travis Kalanick for “30 hours straight, one-on-one, over two weeks,” including over Skype when Travis was traveling. “Throughout those 30 hours,” Pham continued, “I actually forgot it was an interview. It was just like a discussion between two colleagues.”</p>
<p>It also helps to do extensive reference checks on hires and ask for examples of behavior that shows good judgment and high integrity because these traits are hard to test in an interview. And try to learn from cases when you hire or promote the wrong person and are not able to coach them to improve.</p>
<p><strong>3. Personal Integrity and Commitment</strong></p>
<p>Great leaders have exceptional personal integrity and commitment to their mission. Integrity means standing for something meaningful beyond oneself rather than being motivated by narrow personal interests. It means being able to admit when you have made a mistake rather than acting like you are always right and having the humility to receive critical feedback openly and work to improve. It means avoiding behavior like favoritism, conflicts of interest, inappropriate language, inappropriate work relationships, etc., that erode trust. A useful test is to ask yourself: if your team had full transparency into your private communications and behavior towards employees, would you be embarrassed by anything you have done or said? This is a high bar, but one that great leaders strive to meet.</p>
<p>Beyond putting in the time, great leaders make their work into their core life mission in ways that inspire others. They derive deep personal meaning and fulfillment from leading people to achieve a mission. Their personal commitment translates into high levels of personal productivity and execution, which in turn becomes the foundation for pushing their organizations to do the same.</p>
<h3>It All Adds Up To Trust</h3>
<p>So how do you know you are good leader? You are a good leader if you excel in the three areas described above and thereby earn the trust of the people around you.</p>
<p>Building trust in this way is both a science and an art; it requires both competence and character. Trust is built when leaders think clearly about the future and move their organizations to the right place, in terms of product, sales, and people. Do the predictions you make about the future – about the products you should build, the investments you should make, and the changes in competitive or technological landscape – prove to be accurate? And do the people you have chosen to lead in your organization prove to be the right ones? Over time, the answers to these questions become known, and if you answer a lot of these questions correctly, you earn trust. I consider this the “science” of building trust. It’s built on clarity of thought, good communication, and good judgment about people.</p>
<p>The art of building trust is more complicated. It is closely tied with a leader’s ability to communicate with integrity. It is built when you say the right thing at the right time, and show empathy and good judgment. It grows when you stand for ideals bigger than yourself rather than caring primarily about your personal success, wealth, fame, or position. It also grows when you are honest with others, admitting what you don’t know, and not trying to be someone else. This is why you can’t try to copy Steve Jobs or Ed Catmull in your quest to be a great leader. You can only be yourself.</p>
<p>Most leaders understand the science of building trust. They understand that they need to think and communicate clearly about product and strategy and make good choices when they are hiring and promoting people into leadership positions. They understand that they have to show deep commitment and get things done. But in my experience, the truly great leaders also understand the art of building trust. Leaders have to make many hard decisions – firing people, taking responsibility for mistakes, disappointing people by saying no, etc. Great leaders treat these challenges as opportunities to build trust. They ask themselves which course of action and which style of communication will increase the trust that employees have in them. When faced with a difficult challenge, they optimize for trust.</p>
<p>This, perhaps, is the lesson that great leaders teach everyone else. In difficult times, as you evaluate one course of action versus another, ask yourself which path will generate more trust in you as a person and as a leader. Always try to choose that path.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Survey Questions for Evaluating Leaders</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">The best approach to measuring leadership is to evaluate a leader’s performance in the three areas in which all great leaders must excel: clarity of thought / communication, judgment about people, and personal integrity / commitment. Measuring leadership in this way requires gathering data from employees, but most startups have never done this in a systematic way.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">Eventually, all companies need to develop methods to gather employee sentiment and turn it into structured data. In fact one of the core responsibilities of a good HR team is to gather and document employee sentiment and use it to assess leadership.<sup id="footnoteid2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> I suggest that startups begin to gather this data systematically once they reach about 50 people in size.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">Whatever set of data gathering techniques is used, it’s critical to ask the right questions to assess leadership performance. These sample questions are meant to serve as a starting point for a more thorough employee survey. These questions are written to evaluate a CEO, but can easily be adapted to any leader in the company. Part of the goal is to see the level of alignment between a CEO’s responses and that of the employees.</span></p>
